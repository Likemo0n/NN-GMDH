A Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)-type neural network is a self-organizing, inductive learning algorithm that builds a multi-layered model by iteratively selecting the best performing neurons or models based on a predefined criterion. Unlike traditional neural networks that require manual architecture design, GMDH networks automatically evolve their structure during training.
